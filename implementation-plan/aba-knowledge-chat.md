# ABA Knowledge Chat Feature Implementation Plan

## 1. Feature Overview

### Purpose

The ABA Knowledge Chat feature will provide users with an AI-powered conversational interface focused specifically on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) knowledge. This interactive tool will allow users to ask questions, seek clarification, and learn about ABA concepts through natural language conversation.

### Business Problem

Many practitioners, students, and professionals in the ABA field need quick access to accurate information about ABA methodologies, terminology, concepts, and best practices. Traditional learning methods often require extensive searching through textbooks, research papers, or online resources, which can be time-consuming and may not provide immediate answers to specific questions.

### Value Addition

- Provides instant, 24/7 access to ABA knowledge
- Facilitates learning and application of ABA principles
- Reduces time spent searching for information
- Increases engagement with the platform
- Supports professional development for practitioners

### User Stories

- As a BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst), I want to quickly verify specific ABA concepts so I can apply them correctly in my practice.
- As an ABA student, I want to ask questions about terminology and methodologies so I can enhance my understanding of the field.
- As a parent of a child receiving ABA therapy, I want to learn more about behavioral techniques so I can better support my child's progress.
- As a therapist, I want to explore alternative intervention approaches so I can customize treatment plans for my clients.

### Scope and Limitations

- The chat will focus exclusively on ABA knowledge and related fields
- Initial version will be text-based only (no image or document analysis)
- The system will provide disclaimers about not replacing professional advice
- The feature will be available to authenticated users only

## 2. Architecture Overview

### High-Level Description

The ABA Knowledge Chat feature will be implemented as a new module within the existing Praxis Notes application. It will integrate with an AI provider (likely OpenAI or similar) for natural language processing capabilities, while maintaining context about ABA-specific knowledge.

The architecture will follow a client-server model:

- Frontend: Chat interface component with message history
- Backend: API endpoints to handle chat interactions and maintain conversation context
- AI Integration: Connection to an AI service with custom ABA knowledge prompting
- Database: Storage for conversation history and user preferences

## 5. Implementation Details

### Technical Design

The ABA Knowledge Chat will be implemented as a new module in the application, following the existing architectural patterns. It will integrate with an AI service and include specialized prompting for ABA knowledge.

### Integration with Existing Codebase

- The feature will be implemented as a new module under `src/aba-chat/`
- It will leverage existing authentication and user management systems
- UI components will follow the application's design system
- API endpoints will be added to the existing API infrastructure

### New Services and APIs

#### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/aba-chat/conversations` - Create a new conversation
- `GET /api/aba-chat/conversations` - List user's conversations
- `GET /api/aba-chat/conversations/:id` - Get specific conversation with messages
- `DELETE /api/aba-chat/conversations/:id` - Delete a conversation
- `POST /api/aba-chat/conversations/:id/messages` - Add message to conversation

// Example implementation of the AI service integration
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

export class ABAKnowledgeService {
    private client: OpenAI;
    private systemPrompt: string;

    constructor(apiKey: string) {
        this.client = new OpenAI({
            apiKey: apiKey,
        });

        this.systemPrompt = `You are an expert in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).
    Provide accurate, evidence-based information about ABA concepts, methodologies,
    and best practices. Focus on providing educational content that helps users
    understand and apply ABA principles. Always base your responses on established
    ABA research and practices.`;
    }

    async generateResponse(
        messages: Message[],
        userId: string,
    ): Promise<string> {
        try {
            const response = await this.client.chat.completions.create({
                model: 'gpt-4',
                messages: [
                    { role: 'system', content: this.systemPrompt },
                    ...messages.map((m) => ({
                        role: m.role,
                        content: m.content,
                    })),
                ],
                temperature: 0.7,
                max_tokens: 500,
                user: userId,
            });

            return response.choices[0].message.content;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error generating ABA knowledge response:', error);
            throw new Error('Failed to generate response');
        }
    }
}
```

## 7. New Module Guidelines

The ABA Knowledge Chat module will follow the project's module structure conventions:

The module will adhere to the existing coding conventions and patterns used throughout the project. All components will be properly typed using TypeScript.

## 8. Integration and Testing Strategy

### Integration Approach

- The feature will be developed in a feature branch
- Integration will be performed incrementally, starting with database models
- Frontend and backend components will be integrated separately before being combined
- Feature flags will control access during initial rollout

### Testing Approach

#### Unit Tests

- Test each React component in isolation
- Test API endpoints with mock services
- Test AI service integration with mock responses

#### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints with actual database interactions
- Test frontend components with mock API responses
- Test AI integration with sandbox environment

#### End-to-End Tests

- Complete conversation flow from UI to database
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance under normal usage patterns

#### Test Cases

- Create new conversation
- Send message and receive response
- Retrieve conversation history
- Delete conversation
- Handle AI service failure
- Verify token limits and warnings

### Acceptance Criteria

- Users can create and maintain multiple conversations
- AI responses focus on ABA knowledge and are accurate
- UI is responsive and provides clear feedback
- Conversations persist between sessions
- System handles errors gracefully

## 9. Impact on Existing Architecture

### Modifications to Current System

- Add new API routes for chat functionality
- Extend database schema with new tables
- Integrate with existing authentication system

### Potential Risks and Challenges

- AI service costs could scale unexpectedly with usage
- Ensuring AI responses remain focused on ABA knowledge
- Managing performance with long conversation histories

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Implement token usage tracking and limits
- Create specialized ABA knowledge system prompts
- Optimize database queries for conversation retrieval
- Implement caching for frequent queries

### Backward Compatibility

- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- New functionality will be entirely additive
- Feature flags will allow for gradual rollout

## 10. Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Approach

- Deploy database migrations first
- Deploy backend changes with feature flag disabled
- Deploy frontend changes behind feature flag
- Enable feature for internal testing
- Gradually roll out to all users

### Infrastructure Changes

- Potential increase in database storage requirements
- New environment variables for AI service configuration
- Monitoring for AI service usage and costs

### Feature Flag Strategy

- Create `enableABAChat` feature flag
- Initially enabled for developers and testers only
- Gradually roll out to user segments
- Monitor usage and performance before full release

### Rollback Procedures

- Disable feature flag to immediately remove access
- Database migrations can be reversed if needed
- Include version control for AI prompts

## 11. Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements

- Add support for uploading documents for context
- Implement voice input/output capabilities
- Create specialized chat modes for different ABA applications
- Allow sharing of useful conversations between users

### Scalability Considerations
