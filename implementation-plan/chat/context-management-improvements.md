# Chat Context Management Improvements

## Problem Analysis

### Current Issues

1. **Context Window Overload**

    - System loads ALL messages for every AI request via `getChatSession({ sessionId })`
    - Can exceed model context limits (Claude: ~200k tokens, GPT-4: ~128k tokens)
    - Leads to degraded response quality as conversations grow

2. **Memory and Performance Issues**

    - All messages and attachments loaded for each request
    - Individual file fetches for each attachment (N+1 problem)
    - No pagination or limiting mechanisms

3. **No Smart Context Management**

    - All messages treated equally regardless of relevance
    - No conversation summarization
    - No context prioritization based on recency or importance

4. **Database Performance**
    - Each text delta triggers separate database transaction
    - Many small DB operations instead of batching

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Smart Context Window Management

**Token-Aware Message Selection**

- Implement token counting for messages
- Dynamic context window sizing based on model limits
- Sliding window approach with smart message selection

**Message Importance Scoring**

- Recent messages: Higher weight
- System prompts: Always included
- Long messages: Lower priority (can be summarized)
- Messages with attachments: Context-dependent priority

### 2. Conversation Summarization

**Automatic Summarization**

- Summarize conversations when they exceed token thresholds
- Preserve key context and decisions
- Maintain conversation continuity

**Context Preservation**

- Keep recent N messages in full
- Summarize middle conversations
- Always preserve session context and user preferences

### 3. Performance Optimizations

**Lazy Loading**

- Load attachments only when needed
- Paginated message retrieval
- Cached context summaries

**Batch Operations**

- Batch database updates for streaming responses
- Debounced content updates
- Connection pooling optimizations

## Implementation Plan
