# Documentation Rules

## Overview
This rule provides guidelines for creating documentation files using VitePress. All documentation should be:
- User-focused and comprehensive
- Easy to understand with clear explanations
- Created in both English (root) and Spanish (/docs/es) versions
- Consistent with the existing documentation structure

## Base URL
The documentation is published at: https://docs.praxisnotes.com

## Directory Structure
- English documentation: `/docs/[section]/[file].md`
- Spanish documentation: `/docs/es/[section]/[file].md`

## Document Template
When creating a new documentation file, use the following structure:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Overview
Brief description of what this document covers and why it's important for the user.

## Prerequisites
- List any prerequisites or requirements
- Include links to related documentation if needed

## Direct Links to App Functionality
All documentation explaining specific views or functionality must include:

1. Direct links to the corresponding feature in the application
2. Format direct links as: `[Feature Name](https://app.praxisnotes.com/path/to/feature)`
3. Add these links in one or more of these locations:
   - At the first mention of the feature
   - In a "Quick Access" section at the top of the document
   - In a callout box for important features

Example:
```markdown
## Patient Records
Access and manage patient records in the [Patient Dashboard](https://app.praxisnotes.com/patients).
```

## Translation Guidelines
1. Create the English version first
2. Create the Spanish version in the corresponding path under `/docs/es/`
3. Ensure translations preserve technical terms where appropriate
4. Adapt examples to be culturally relevant if necessary

## Formatting Guidelines
1. Use h1 (#) for the document title only
2. Use h2 (##) for main sections
3. Use h3 (###) for subsections
4. Use bullet points for lists where order doesn't matter
5. Use numbered lists for sequential steps
6. Include code blocks with proper language syntax highlighting
7. Include screenshots or diagrams when they help clarify concepts

## Front Matter
Include VitePress front matter at the top of each document:

```markdown
---
title: [Document Title]
description: [Brief description for SEO]
---
```

## Special Considerations
1. Ensure all links work correctly in both language versions
2. Update the sidebar navigation in `.vitepress/config.js` when adding new documents
3. Include version information when documenting version-specific features
4. Verify all direct links to app functionality are correct and up-to-date

## Creating New Documentation
When creating new documentation, always:
1. Check for existing similar documentation to maintain consistency
2. Ensure the document addresses the user's specific needs and questions
3. Test all provided examples and instructions
4. Validate all links and references
5. Create both language versions
6. Include direct links to relevant app functionality
