2. Find and select the client for whom you want to create a session note
3. Click "View Sessions" to access their sessions list
4. Click the "New Session" button in the top-right corner

### Step 2: Entering Basic Session Information

Complete the Session Details section:

1. **Session Date**: Select the date when the session occurred using the calendar picker
2. **Location**: Enter where the session took place (e.g., "Daycare", "Home", "Office")
3. **Start Time**: Enter the session start time and select AM/PM
4. **End Time**: Enter the session end time and select AM/PM

### Step 3: Recording Session Participants

In the Present Participants section:

1. Type each participant's role or name in the field (e.g., "Teacher", "Mom", "Therapist")
2. Press Enter after each entry to add it as a tag
3. To remove a participant, click the "Ã—" next to their name
4. Click "Add" to confirm all participants are included

### Step 4: Documenting Environmental Changes

In the Environmental Changes section:

2. Press Enter after each entry to add it as a tag
3. If there were no significant environmental changes, type "Nothing" and press Enter
4. Click "Add" to confirm all environmental factors are documented

### Step 5: Recording ABC Data

The ABC (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) section helps track behavioral incidents:

For each replacement behavior program:

1. **Replacement Program**: Enter the program being implemented
2. **Teaching Procedure**: Document the teaching method used

4. **Prompting Procedure**: Document the specific prompting strategy
5. **Client Response**: Select how the client responded to the intervention
6. **Progress**: Enter a numerical value representing progress (e.g., percentage)
7. Click "Add Replacement Program Entry" for additional programs

### Step 7: Rating the Session

![Session Valuation and Observations](/images/session/create-client-session-valuation-and-observations.png)

In the Session Valuation section:

1. Select one option to rate how the overall session went:
    - Fair
    - Good
    - Poor

### Step 8: Adding General Observations

In the Observations section:

1. Enter any additional notes, patterns, or important details about the session
2. Be specific and objective in your descriptions
3. Include information that doesn't fit neatly into the structured sections

### Step 9: Generating or Saving the Note

When you've completed all required sections:

1. Click "Save as Draft" to save your progress without finalizing
2. Click "Generate Notes" to create a formatted clinical note based on your inputs

## FAQ

**Q: How long does it take to create a complete session note?**
A: With practice, most clinicians can complete a thorough session note in 10-15 minutes.

**Q: Can I use templates for common session scenarios?**
A: You can save draft sessions as templates by using the "Save as Draft" option. These can be duplicated and modified for similar future sessions.

**Q: Are all fields required?**
A: Required fields are marked with an asterisk (\*). However, for comprehensive documentation, it's recommended to complete all relevant sections.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cannot save or submit the form

Solution: Check for any fields highlighted in red, which indicate required information is missing.

### Problem: ABC data entry isn't saving

Solution: Ensure you've selected both a behavior and an intervention before proceeding.

### Problem: Session time validation errors

Solution: Verify that the end time is later than the start time and that both are in the correct format.
