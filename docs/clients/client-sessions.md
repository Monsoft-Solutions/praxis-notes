# Managing Client Sessions

## Overview

Client sessions are a core component of Praxis Notes, allowing you to document therapy sessions, track behavioral data, and generate insurance-ready notes. This guide covers how to view existing sessions, create new sessions, and manage session data effectively.

## Prerequisites

- A Praxis Notes account with appropriate permissions
- At least one client already added to your account
- Basic understanding of [client management](/clients/managing-clients)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Accessing Client Sessions

1. Navigate to the [Clients Dashboard](https://app.praxisnotes.com/clients)
2. Find the client for whom you want to manage sessions
3. Click on the client's name or select "View Details"
4. Click the "View Sessions" button to access all sessions for this client

### Step 2: Viewing Existing Sessions

The [Sessions View](https://app.praxisnotes.com/clients/sessions) displays a chronological list of all previous sessions for the selected client, showing:

- Session date
- Session time period
- Location
- A "View Details" button to access the complete session record

### Step 3: Creating a New Session

1. From the client's sessions page, click the [New Session](https://app.praxisnotes.com/clients/sessions/new) button in the top-right corner
2. You'll be taken to the session creation form with several sections to complete

### Step 4: Completing Session Details

Fill out the basic session information:

- **Session Date**: Select the date the session occurred
- **Location**: Enter where the session took place (e.g., "Daycare", "Home", "Clinic")
- **Start Time**: Enter when the session began
- **End Time**: Enter when the session ended

### Step 5: Recording Participants

1. In the "Present Participants" field, type each participant's role or name
2. Press Enter after each entry to add them as a tag
3. You can remove participants by clicking the "x" next to their name

### Step 6: Documenting Environmental Changes

1. In the "Environmental Changes" field, document any relevant changes to the environment
2. Press Enter after each entry to add them as a tag
3. If there were no changes, you can add "Nothing" as shown in the example

### Step 7: Recording ABC Data

The ABC (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) section allows you to document behavioral incidents:

For each entry:

1. Enter the Activity/Antecedent (what happened before the behavior)
2. Select the Function from the dropdown
3. Select relevant Behaviors from the options or add new ones
4. Select Interventions used
5. To add additional ABC entries, click "Add ABC Entry"

### Step 8: Recording Replacement Program Data

Document the replacement behaviors being taught:

For each program:

1. Select the Replacement Program being used
2. Record the Teaching Procedure employed
3. Select the Prompts used during the session
4. Enter the Prompting Procedure
5. Document the Client Response
6. Record the Progress (numerical value)
7. To add additional programs, click "Add Replacement Program Entry"

### Step 9: Session Valuation

Rate how the overall session went by selecting one option:

- Fair
- Good
- Poor

### Step 10: Adding Observations

In the Observations text area, document any general notes, patterns, or important details about the session that don't fit into the structured sections above.

### Step 11: Generating Notes

1. After completing all required fields, you have two options:
    - Click "Save as Draft" to save your progress without finalizing
    - Click "Generate Notes" to create an insurance-ready clinical note based on your inputs
2. The generated note will be available for review, editing, and submission to insurance providers

## FAQ

**Q: Can I edit a session after it's been created?**
A: Yes, you can edit any session by accessing it from the sessions list and clicking the Edit button.

**Q: Are there templates available for common session scenarios?**
A: Currently, the system uses a standard form for all sessions, but you can save drafts of common scenarios to use as starting points.

**Q: How detailed should my ABC data be?**
A: Include enough detail to clearly identify patterns and inform treatment decisions, but focus on the most significant behaviors rather than documenting every minor occurrence.

**Q: Can I attach files or images to a session?**
A: This feature is currently in development and will be available in a future update.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Session won't save or generate notes

Solution: Ensure all required fields are completed. Required fields are typically marked with an asterisk (\*).

### Problem: Session time shows in wrong format

Solution: Make sure you're entering time in the correct format (HH:MM) and selecting AM/PM accurately.

### Problem: Can't find a specific behavior in the dropdown options

Solution: You can add custom behaviors by typing them and pressing Enter. If you frequently use certain behaviors, contact support to have them added to the standard options.
