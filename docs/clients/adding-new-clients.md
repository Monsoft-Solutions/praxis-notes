# Adding New Clients

Praxis Notes uses a comprehensive multi-step process to add new clients to your system. This structured approach ensures you capture all the essential information needed for effective ABA therapy documentation.

## The Client Creation Process

Adding a new client follows a 5-step wizard that guides you through entering all necessary information:

1. Basic Info
2. Behaviors
3. Programs
4. Interventions
5. Review

## Step 1: Basic Information

The first step is to enter the client's personal information:

- **First Name** (required)
- **Last Name** (required)
- **Gender** (required)
- **Notes** (optional): Any additional information about the client

This essential information forms the foundation of the client's record in the system.

## Step 2: Behaviors

In this step, you'll document the behaviors that need to be addressed:

- Click "Add Behavior" to add a new behavior
- For each behavior, specify:
    - **Behavior** (required): Select or enter the behavior
    - **Type** (required): Choose the type (e.g., frequency)
    - **Baseline** (required): Enter the starting measurement

You can add multiple behaviors as needed for comprehensive tracking.

## Step 3: Replacement Programs

This step allows you to add replacement programs to address the behaviors:

- Click "Add Program" to add a new program
- For each program, specify:
    - **Program** (required): Select the replacement program
    - **Baseline** (required): Enter the starting measurement
    - **Associated Behaviors**: Link the program to specific behaviors

Programs help track interventions that replace unwanted behaviors with positive alternatives.

In this step, you'll add specific interventions to implement:

- Click "Add Intervention" to add a new intervention
- For each intervention, specify:

    - **Associated Behaviors**: Connect the intervention to target behaviors

Interventions document the specific strategies used in therapy sessions.
