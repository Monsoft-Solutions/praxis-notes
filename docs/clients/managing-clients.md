- View a list of all your clients
- Add new clients to your practice
- Access individual client session records

### Viewing Your Client List

Your client list displays all active clients in your system. Each client card includes:

- Client name
- Quick access to view all sessions for that client

If you haven't added any clients yet, you'll see an empty state with a prompt to add your first client.

### Accessing Client Sessions

To view a client's session history:

1. Locate the client in your dashboard list
2. Click the "View Sessions" button on the client's card
3. This will take you to the complete session history for that client
