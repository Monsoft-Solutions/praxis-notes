# ABC Data Collection Guide

## What is ABC Data?

ABC data refers to Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence data, which is a fundamental observation method in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). It helps identify patterns and functions of behaviors by documenting:

- **Antecedent**: What happened immediately before the behavior
- **Behavior**: The specific behavior observed
- **Consequence**: What happened immediately after the behavior

## How to Collect ABC Data

### Antecedent

Record environmental factors or events that occurred right before the behavior:

- Time of day
- Location
- Activities in progress
- People present
- Instructions or demands given
- Changes in routine

### Behavior

Document the observable behavior in specific, measurable terms:

- What exactly did the client do?
- How long did it last?
- What was the intensity?
- Use objective language, avoiding interpretations

### Consequence

Document what happened immediately after the behavior:

- How did others respond?
- What changed in the environment?
- Did the client gain or avoid something?
- What interventions were implemented?

## Using ABC Data in Treatment Planning

ABC data helps identify the function of behaviors, which typically fall into these categories:

- Access to attention
- Access to tangibles/activities
- Escape/avoidance
- Sensory stimulation

Identifying these patterns allows you to develop more effective intervention strategies.
