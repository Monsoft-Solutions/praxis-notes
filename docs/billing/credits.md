# Credits System

## Overview

The Praxis Notes platform has introduced a credits system to provide users with flexible access to advanced features. Credits are consumed when using specific features, with consumption rates varying based on the selected options. This document explains how credits work, how they're allocated across different plans, and how to manage them.

## Prerequisites

- An active Praxis Notes account
- A subscription to one of our plans (Individual, Pro, or Team)

## Understanding Credits

### What are Credits?

Credits are the currency used within Praxis Notes to access premium features like AI-powered note generation. Each feature may consume a different amount of credits based on its complexity and the resources required.

### Default Credit Allocation

Each subscription plan comes with a different number of monthly credits:

- **Individual Plan**: 30 credits per month
- **Pro Plan**: 60 credits per month
- **Team Plan**: 200 credits per month

Credits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle.

## Credit Usage

### Notes Generation

When generating notes using our AI models, credits are consumed based on the model selected:

| Model  | Credit Consumption |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| Genius | 1 credit           |
| Smart  | 0.8 credits        |
