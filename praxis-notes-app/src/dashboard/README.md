# Dashboard Module

The Dashboard module provides an overview of the user's organization data, displaying various analytics and data sections in a modular way.

## Features

-   **Modular Dashboard Sections**: Dashboard is constructed from independent, reusable components
-   **Clients Overview**: Displays a list of all clients in the user's organization with their basic information
-   **Quick Navigation**: Direct access to client sessions and adding new clients

## Components

-   `Dashboard`: The main component that acts as a container for dashboard sections
-   `DashboardView`: The view component that renders the dashboard layout
-   `ClientsOverview`: Component that displays client data with its own data fetching logic

## Architecture

The dashboard follows a modular approach where:

-   Each dashboard section is implemented as an independent component
-   Each section handles its own data fetching and state management
-   The main dashboard view simply composes these sections together
-   This allows for easy addition of new dashboard sections

## Future Enhancements

-   Add charts and analytics for client data visualization
-   Include recent activity tracking
-   Display statistics about notes and sessions
-   Filter options for clients
-   Add pagination for large client lists
-   Create additional dashboard sections for different data types
